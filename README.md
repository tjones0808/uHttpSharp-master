## Usage

A [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/uHttpSharp/ "Go to µHttpSharp NuGet Package page")  is available, Install via NuGet Package Manager :

	install-package uHttpSharp

A sample for usage : 

	using (var httpServer = new HttpServer(new HttpRequestProvider()))
	{
		// Normal port 80 :
		httpServer.Use(new TcpListenerAdapter(new TcpListener(IPAddress.Loopback, 80)));
        
		// Ssl Support :
		var serverCertificate = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile(@"TempCert.cer");
		httpServer.Use(new ListenerSslDecorator(new TcpListenerAdapter(new TcpListener(IPAddress.Loopback, 443)), serverCertificate));

		// Request handling : 
		httpServer.Use((context, next) => {
			Console.WriteLine("Got Request!");
			return next();
		});

		// Handler classes : 
		httpServer.Use(new TimingHandler());
		httpServer.Use(new HttpRouter().With(string.Empty, new IndexHandler())
										.With("about", new AboutHandler()));
		httpServer.Use(new FileHandler());
		httpServer.Use(new ErrorHandler());
		
		httpServer.Start();
		
		Console.ReadLine();
	}
